# jengAR

JengAR is a one-player, augmented reality game in which users can interact with a pre-existing Jenga tower containing 48 blocks. Like the real life Jenga game, users are able to select a block from the base of the tower and place it on the top of the tower. The userâ€™s goal is to avoid collision and collapse of the tower. If the block placement causes an imbalance of the Jenga structure, the program will detect this fault, resulting in the tower toppling over, and terminating the game. JengAR is designed to mimic real Jenga as closely as possible, just with different control mechanisms.
